              Over the past year, I have embarked on my journey as a freelance
              designer, engaging in a variety of remote projects. I have offered
              consultation services to startups and actively participated in
              collaborations with skilled individuals to develop digital
              products targeted at both business and consumer audiences. With a
              quiet confidence and a natural curiosity, I am constantly striving
              to enhance my design skills by tackling diverse design challenges
              as they arise. My commitment to continuous improvement drives me
              to overcome design obstacles one step at a time.
